But the key takeaways here are:\n\n1. The rise of revenue is phenomenal for 'Email + Call' method from 3rd - 4th week, likely due to calling each customer on the third week after sending an email beforehand.\n\n2. As we can that here again the revenue generated using the 'Call' sales method is very less over the 6 weeks.\n\n\n![Screenshot 2025-07-04 205717](Screenshot%202025-07-04%20205717.png)\n","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"e7a206ee-3a32-4dc9-9d31-d0033849bbc7"},{"source":"### Based on the data, which method would you recommend we continue to use?\n\nSince the number of products sold increases as the customer visits our website more often for each method.
